I wanted to updated my personal website for a really long time. I built the first version in 2016, a few months before lending my first job as a software engineer.

In the last 6 years, I started to build (and almost finished) a new version of the website three times. I created and never published version in Angular 4 and one in Next JS. After working on the project for a few weeks, I always felt I was using a not-that-cool or not suitable technologies. Which, looking back, it was a ridiculous thing to do.

Anyway, This year I completely changed my way to approach the problem. I started listing the main reasons why I wanted a new website, trying to make the list as concise as possible.

I ended up with the following improvement compared with the previous website:

- more energy efficient (yes, it's a thing and I'm kind of obsesses with it)
- faster and more optimised
- it had to feature a blog

I also made a promise to myself: as soon as I were to achieved the aforementioned basic features, I would publish the website, even if there wasn't feature-parity with the previous one.

So today is the day! I finally published my (unfinished) new personal website and I'm quite please with what I have done so far. It's still missing a lot of information compare with the previous one:

- career page
- about page
- portfolio of projects
- a gallery of my photos

They are all sections and pages that I'm going to add in the next few week. Before wrapping up this first blog post (exciting!), let me brag about a couple of things that are under the hood:

### Energy Efficiency

  alt="carbon score"
  width={1000}
  height={1000}
  placeholder="blur"
  loading="lazy"
  class="rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

The website is rated as more efficient than the 96% of the world wide web. I achieve it with a combination of assets optimisation, server side rendering and an extremely small amount of JavaScript shipped to the client. Svelte (the framework that I used) really helped me with that.

### Fast and optimised

The website has a perfect Lighthouse score. It loads fast....

  width={762}
  height={753}
  placeholder="blur"
  loading="lazy"
  class="rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

### It feature a blog

The only feature that it has is a blog section. This allows me to stop procrastinating and finding excuses to not to write some tech articles.
I'm using Markdown to write the articles. I'll create a separate post for that.

### It's (proudly) incomplete

It's missing the career page, the list of my skills, and about page etc, but I'll build them in the next few weeks.
