I wanted to updated my personal website for a really long time. I'll tell you more, I started to build (and almost finished) the new one three times in the past few years.

<br />

It took me such a along time (my previous website was dated 2016) because I couldn't decided which tech stack to use and for the lack of free time. As I mentioned before, I attempted to build it three times and I never managed to finish it because I always felt I was using not-that-cool or not suitable technologies.

<br />

This year I completely changed my way to approach the problem. I started **laying** out the main reasons why I wanted a new website and the most important features.
<br />

I ended up with the following list:

<br />

- energy efficient
- fast
- feature a blog

<br />

As soon as I would achieved the aforementioned basic features, I would have to publish the website, no matter what.

<br />

So today I finally published my (unfinished) new personal website and I'm quite please with what I have.

<br />
<br />

<h3 class="font-bold">Energy Efficiency</h3>

<br />

The website is rated as more efficient than the 96% of the world wide web. I achieve it with a combination of assets optimisation, server side rendering and an extremely small amount of JavaScript shipped to the client. Svelte (the framework that I used) really helped me with that.

<br />
<br />

<h3 class="font-bold">Fast</h3>

<br />

The website has a perfect Lighthouse score. It loads fast....

<br />
<br />

<h3 class="font-bold">Feature a blog</h3>

<br />

The only feature that it has is a blog section. This allows me to stop procrastinating and finding excuses to not to write some tech articles.
I'm using Markdown to write the articles. I'll create a separate post for that.

<br />

### It's (proudly) incomplete

<br />

It's missing the career page, the list of my skills, and about page etc, but I'll build them in the next few weeks.

<br />

You can find the code on the following Github repo: ....
