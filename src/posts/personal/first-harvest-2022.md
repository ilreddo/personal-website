With a little bit of planning done in August 2021, I managed to have the first harvest of 2022 extremely early.

As you can see from the picture, nothing crazy, just a bunch of delicious dwarf carrots and Brussels sprouts.

Brussels sprouts kept producing until February. It was an amazing addition to the garden as they provided food for almost for months (from late November until late February).
