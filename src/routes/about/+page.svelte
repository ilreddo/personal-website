    My name is Antonio and I am a software engineer with a passion for developing green software. I
    specialize in React, Svelte, Node, AWS, and Typescript, and I have years of experience
    developing efficient and sustainable software solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I strongly believe in the importance of creating software that is environmentally responsible,
    and I am committed to incorporating eco-friendly practices into my work whenever possible. By
    focusing on reducing energy consumption, minimizing waste, and using sustainable resources, I
    strive to create software that is efficient, cost-effective and environmentally conscious.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I'm not coding, you usually find me trail running in the countryside or climbing. I have a
    deep appreciation for nature and enjoy spending time in the great outdoors. I enjoy traveling
    slow, by train, bicycle, or on foot. I did the Camino de Santiago and several other
    long-distance walks and hikes.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my free time, I also grow my own food in an allotment, which allows me to practice
    sustainable living and connect with the earth.
